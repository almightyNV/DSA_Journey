Given a bitonic sequence of n distinct elements, and an integer x, the task is to write a program to find given element x in the bitonic sequence in O(log n) time. 

A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers that is first strictly increasing then after a point decreasing.

Examples: 

Input :  arr[] = {-3, 9, 18, 20, 17, 5, 1}, key = 20
Output : Found at index 3


Input :  arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 3, 2, 1}, key = 30
Output : Not Found
